title: Schema linting
description: With GraphOS
---

GraphOS provides a **schema linter** that can enforce recommended formatting conventions and other GraphQL best practices in every change to your graph's schema.

Linting runs alongside your graph's other [schema checks](./schema-checks/), enabling you to integrate it seamlessly into your CI pipeline.

## Studio setup

To configure lint checks in Studio, navigate to the Linter tab from the Checks page.
Under Default Linter Configuration you will see the default linter settings for variants of this graph. Enabling the linter will run the linter on all graph variants. Note that the linter will only run on modified parts of your schema and not the entire schema.

You can choose to ignore rule violations on @deprecated definitions and @inacessible definitions.

The next section of this page contains the list of linter rules with their name, description, and severity level.

The severity level defaults to Error but you can use the toggle to configure to a lower severity, warning.

To see the full list of lint rules please refer to the List of Lint Rules and Examples section below (TODO: link to section)
