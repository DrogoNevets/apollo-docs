GraphOS provides **schema linting** to help you enforce formatting conventions and other GraphQL best practices with every proposed change to your graph's schema.

- **If you set up [schema checks](./schema-checks/) for your graph,** linting runs as a separate check type alongside build and operation checks.
- You can also perform [one-off linting with the Rover CLI](#one-off-linting-with-the-rover-cli).

> **Note:** Currently, GraphOS linting only analyzes parts of your modified schema that differ from your _published_ schema. It does _not_ flag any _existing_ violations.

## Configuring the linter

The GraphOS schema linter uses a [predefined collection of rules](./linter-rules/) to identify issues with proposed schema changes.

- You can configure how each variant of your graph treats violations of each linter rule.
- You can also define **graph-wide linter defaults** for any variants you _don't_ configure individually.

**Navigate to your linter's configuration:**

1. In [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content), go to your graph's **Checks** page.
2. Click **Configuration** in the upper right to open the checks configuration page.
3. From the checks configuration page, open the **Linter** section:

      class="screenshot"

      width="700"
    />

4. **To configure graph-wide linter defaults** for _all_ of your variants, click the **This Graph** tab.

    **To configure just the current variant,** remain on the **This Variant** tab.

This page organizes linter options into the following categories:

- **General Linter Configuration** provides high-level options, including disabling the linter entirely.
- **Approved @tag names** enables you to specify approved values for the `name` argument of the `@tag` directive. This directive is used most commonly with [GraphOS contracts](./contracts/).
  - If you don't use the `@tag` directive, you can ignore this category.
  - Using a _non_-approved value for `name` raises the `TAG_DIRECTIVE_USES_UNKNOWN_NAME` violation.
- **Linter Rules** enables you to [set the severity level](#setting-severity-levels) for violations of each rule.

If you're configuring a single variant, each category displays a **Use Graph Settings** toggle in the upper right. If this toggle is enabled, the variant uses whatever graph-wide defaults are set for that category.

### Setting severity levels

The **Linter Rules** category of your linter configuration displays all predefined rules and the current **severity** level for each:

  />

Click a rule's severity to set it to any of the following:

- **Error.** Any violation of this rule causes the associated linter check to fail.
    - This in turn causes the _entire schema checks run_ to fail, which is useful for failing builds in CI.
- **Warn.** Violations of this rule are flagged in checks reports, but they _don't_ cause the associated linter check to fail.
- **Ignore.** Violations of this rule are ignored entirely.
