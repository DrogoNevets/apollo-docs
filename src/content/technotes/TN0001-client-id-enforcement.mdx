As part of the Studio metrics reporting, you can [tag the request with the client name and version](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/client-awareness). This info can be extremely useful to schema authors to understand who is using certain fields in the graph and who to contact when changes or deprecations need to be made. Clients also have the ability to [name their operations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/operation-best-practices/#name-all-operations), which can provide more context around how and where the data is being used within the client. Together these pieces of info make a graph much easier to monitor and allows teams to communicate with each other successfully.

We strongly encourage gateway maintainers to require that the client name, client version, and operation name are included in every request. Once clients start using the graph without this info, it is much more difficult to make them go back and update their existing code. You can add this requirement as an [Apollo Server plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/builtin-plugins) in your gateway:

## Plugin Code
```js
const clientEnforcementPlugin = {
  requestDidStart: ({ request, logger }) => {
    let clientName = request.http.headers.get(
      'apollographql-client-name'
    );
    let clientVersion = request.http.headers.get(
      'apollographql-client-version'
    );

    if (!clientName) {
      let logString = `Execution Denied: Operation has no identified client`;
      logger.debug(logString);

      throw new ApolloError(logString);
    }

    if (!clientVersion) {
      let logString = `Execution Denied: Client ${clientName} has no identified version`;
      logger.debug(logString);

      throw new ApolloError(logString);
    }

    return {
      parsingDidStart({ queryHash, request }) {
        if (!request.operationName) {
          logger.debug(`Unnamed Operation: ${queryHash}`);

          let error = new ApolloError(
            'Execution denied: Unnamed operation'
          );

          Object.assign(error.extensions, {
            queryHash: queryHash,
            clientName: clientName,
            clientVersion: clientVersion,
            exception: {
              message: `All operations must be named`
            }
          });

          throw error;
        }
      }
    };
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
  subscriptions: false,
  plugins: [clientEnforcementPlugin]
});
```

## Adding enforcement for existing clients

If clients are already consuming your graph and _are not_ providing client metadata, adding universal enforcement will _break_ those clients. To resolve this you should take the following steps:

### Use other headers

If you have other existing headers in your HTTP requests that can be parsed to extract some client info, you can extract the info from there.

If you do change the identifying headers, also update the [Usage Reporting Plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/client-awareness/#advanced-apollo-server-configuration) to use the new headers so that the proper client info is also sent to Studio.

### Ask clients to update their requests

The long-term fix will require that clients start sending the required headers needed to extract client info. While clients are working on updating their requests you can add the plugin code to your gateway, but instead of throwing an error you can log a warning so that the gateway team can track when all requests have been updated.
