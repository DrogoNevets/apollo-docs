When comparing Federation to other API technology in the market today, a natural first comparison to draw is to API gateways. Tools like Apigee, Kong, or MuleSoft offer capabilities to secure, manage, and monitor your endpoints through their product.
Sometimes these gateways are required by your security team so that all inbound and outbound service traffic flows through the same top layer of your tech stack. If you have these requirements in place, you can continue to use Apollo Router with these services.

The key distinction of the router is that is not based on URLs or REST endpoints; Apollo Router is a GraphQL-native solution to traffic gateway requirements.
