After client teams publish operations to a graph's PQL, you can configure router instances to fetch and use the PQL by following these steps:

1. Ensure your router instances are ready to work with PQLs:
    - Make sure you're using version `1.25.0` or later of the Apollo Router.
    - Make sure your router instances are [connected to your GraphOS Enterprise organization](/graphos/enterprise-features/#enabling-enterprise-features) and that they're associated with a variant that your PQL is linked to.

2. Set your desired security level in your router's YAML config file. For supported options, see [router security levels](#router-security-levels).

3. Deploy your updated router instances to begin using your PQL.
