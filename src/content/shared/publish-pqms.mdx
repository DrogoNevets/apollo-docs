<blockquote>

Ensure your Rover CLI version is `0.17.2` or later. Previous versions of Rover don't support publishing operations to a PQL.
[Download the latest version.](/rover/getting-started/)

After you [generate an operation manifest](#31-generate-persisted-queries-manifests), you publish it to your PQL with the [Rover CLI](/rover/):

```bash title="Example command"
rover persisted-queries publish my-graph@my-variant \
  --manifest ./persisted-query-manifest.json
```

- Replace `my-graph@my-variant` with the **graph ref** of _any_ variant your PQL is [linked to](#12-link-the-pql-to-variants). Your platform team can provide this for you.
    - Graph refs have the format `graph-id@variant-name`.
- For the `--manifest` option, provide the path to the manifest you want to publish.

<blockquote>

As with [generating manifests](#31-generate-persisted-queries-manifests), execute this command in your CI/CD pipeline to publish new operations as part of your app release process.

</blockquote>

**The above command does the following:**

1. It publishes all operations in the provided manifest file to the PQL linked to the specified variant.
    - Publishing a manifest to a PQL is additive. Any _existing_ entries in the PQL remain.
    - If you publish an operation with the same `id` but different details from an existing entry in the PQL, the entire publish command fails with an error.

2. It updates any _other_ variants that the PQL is applied to so that routers associated with those variants can fetch their updated PQL.

As with manifest generation, you can execute this command in your CI/CD pipeline to publish new operations as part of your app release process.

#### Test operations

You can send some test operations to test that you've successfully published your manifests:

First, start your GraphOS-connected router:

```bash
APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router --config ./router.yaml

2023-05-11T15:32:30.684460Z  INFO Apollo Router v1.18.1 // (c) Apollo Graph, Inc. // Licensed as ELv2 (https://go.apollo.dev/elv2)
2023-05-11T15:32:30.684480Z  INFO Anonymous usage data is gathered to inform Apollo product development.  See https://go.apollo.dev/o/privacy for details.

2023-05-11T15:32:31.507823Z  INFO GraphQL endpoint exposed at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ ðŸš€
```

Next, make a POST request with `curl`, like so:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000 -X POST --json \
'{"extensions":{"persistedQuery":{"version":1,"sha256Hash":"dc67510fb4289672bea757e862d6b00e83db5d3cbbcfb15260601b6f29bb2b8f"}}}'
```

If your router's PQL includes an operation with an ID that matches the value of the provided `sha256Hash` property, it executes the corresponding operation and returns its result.
