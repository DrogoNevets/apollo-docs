We recommend you follow this order while implementing:

| Implementation Step | Required for PQs? | Required for APQs? |
| -----| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. Generate operation manifests| ✅ | -- |
| 2. Publish operation manifests to a PQL |✅ | -- |
| 3. Enable persisted queries on the client when it makes requests | ✅ | ✅ |

The rest of this article details these steps.

Persisted queries also requires you to create and link a PQL, and to configure your router. For more information on the other configuration aspects of persisted queries, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).
