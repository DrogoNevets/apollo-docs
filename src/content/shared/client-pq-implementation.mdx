Both persisted queries and APQs require you to configure your code generation models and how your client makes requests. Because the persisted queries feature requires preregistering trusted operations, it has the additional implementation step of publishing an operations manifest to a persisted queries list (PQL).

We recommend you follow this order while implementing:

| Implementation Step | Required for APQs? | Required for PQs? |
| -----| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. Configure generated operation models | ✅ | ✅ |
| 2. Generate and publish operation manifests to a PQL | -- | ✅ |
| 3. Enable persisted queries on the client when it makes requests | ✅ | ✅ |

The rest of this article details these steps.

Persisted queries also requires you to create and link a PQL, and to configure your router. For more information on the other configuration aspects of persisted queries, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).
